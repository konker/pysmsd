Handlers for (currently) incoming messages live here.
Handlers should live in their own module and implement something based on the following:

class Handler:
    def handle(self, db, id):
        # ... handle message from database db with given message id

print_handler.py has an example.

To activate a handler it must exist in the pysmsd.handlers.enabled package. The daemon automatically tries to load all modules in this package.

A typical way to do this is to have the handler module in this directory and then symlink it into enabled/.
